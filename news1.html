        <h3 class="card-title">Started working on the website builder</h3>
        <p class="card-description">Hey there! <br><br><br> So, I updated the website (New UI and stuff). This means that now I can start working on the website editor, however on realese it will have very little features as it's coded by me solo without any help! As of right now I'm hoping to create many features, which I will probably have to scrap over time. However I have made a basic code already, that works but doesn't really. That's everything for today. A final note: this news “Article” is very short, and I'm mainly using it for testing. <br><br><br> Have a nice day - Mythren</p>
